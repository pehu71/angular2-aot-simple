----- IMPORTANT -------

* set WebStorm not to recompile generated factories in his way, it must be done by rollup
* exclude "aot" folder in tsconfig.json and DO NOT RUN COMPILE ALL until rollup finishes!!!


COMPILATION COMMANDS

Angular template compiler:
node_modules\.bin\ngc -p tsconfig-aot.json

Rollup build
node_modules\.bin\rollup -c rollup.js
